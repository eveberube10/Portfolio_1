        <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
        <p>
          For my extracurricular activities, I love running and last year i was a member
          of my schools track and cross country team. i am also a part of a stutdent initiative
          called VOICE ( Visions of Improving Connections in Education ) 
          We have developed the most effective system to improve school experiences through conversation.
          The first thing we do is set up a meeting with the teacher to understand their outlook on the class and to gather any questions they want us to ask the students.
          Our second step is learning about the class's structure and understanding how it is set up and why.
          This step is the main focus of our initiative, and it is the key process that allows Good Trouble student mediators to gather honest feedback straight from the source. 
          Shortly after every student feedback session, we have a session with the teacher, where we have conversations about student responses.
          Once the teacher has received their students' feedback, we give them around a month to implement changes before we check back in.
